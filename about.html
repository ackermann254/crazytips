        <h1>hi, am ackermann</h1> 
        <p>
            I'm an aspiring betting tipster cribbing in East africa. Ive been analysing how teams perform and ive come up with brilliant ways of makiing money from taking sides from various betting sites. Am trying to solve the problem that most "gamblers" go through while they suffer when they try to make something gambling. Am not advocating that you wont lose money but i trust that i can provide a good winning streaks for my followers.
